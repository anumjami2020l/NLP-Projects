# 🧠 NLP Projects

This repository contains my work in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, ranging from research and academic projects to applied AI solutions. These projects cover text classification, sentiment analysis, conversational AI, OCR, generative AI, and more—implemented using state-of-the-art deep learning models and modern deployment practices.

## 📂 Projects

### 1. **A Comparative Study of LSTM, BERT, and GRU for Disaster Tweet Classification**
- Research paper implementation comparing LSTM, GRU, and BERT for multiclass disaster tweet classification.
- Achieved **95% accuracy** with BERT, outperforming GRU (83%) and LSTM (83%).
- Techniques: Tokenization, embeddings, model training & evaluation.

### 2. **Classification and Sentiment Analysis Using BERT and GRU**
- Implemented text classification and sentiment analysis pipelines.
- Compared performance of GRU and BERT for understanding nuanced sentiments.

### 3. **AI_Agents**
- Exploration of AI agent frameworks (CrewAI, LangGraph, PhiData) for automated NLP workflows.
- Used RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) for knowledge-based responses.

### 4. **Conversational Chatbot**
- Rule-based and deep learning-based chatbot implementations.
- Integrated intent classification, entity recognition, and dialogue management.

### 5. **Fine_Tuning**
- Fine-tuning of transformer models (BERT, GPT variants) for domain-specific NLP tasks.

### 6. **Generative_AI**
- Leveraged text-to-text and multimodal generation using LLMs.
- Includes experiments with OpenAI APIs and Hugging Face models.

### 7. **LLM**
- Exploration of Large Language Models (LLaMA, GPT, Falcon) for text generation and summarization.
- Includes experiments with Ollama for low-latency inference.

### 8. **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)**
- Text extraction from images using Tesseract OCR and transformer-based models.
- Preprocessing pipeline for noise reduction and improved accuracy.

### 9. **Scrapping**
- Web scraping pipelines for collecting large-scale NLP datasets.
- Includes cleaning and preprocessing scripts for downstream ML tasks.

### 10. **ollama-docker-fastapi-main**
- Containerized deployment of LLM inference APIs using Docker & FastAPI.
